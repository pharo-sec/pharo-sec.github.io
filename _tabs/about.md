I am a Penetration Tester for with an extensive background in network and application penetration testing. I would like to eventually work in a red teaming role where I can learn and use a wide variety of attack vectors, tools, and techniques.

I currently hold the OSCP and CRTP and am looking to get certified in web application testing.
