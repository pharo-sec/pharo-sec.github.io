# Journey to OSCP

## The First Attempt: A Humbling Introduction
Embarking on the OSCP journey for the first time, I didn't know what to expect. I had done the 3 months of training provided by OffSec and had completed about 30 of their lab machines. I started th test strong, scored 25 points on the buffer overflow (This was before the change to the AD-based exam), and another 10 points on the "easy" box. However, reality quickly set in as I began struggling with the sheer amount of rabbit holes. Despite my best efforts, I fell short of the passing score and only got 35/100 points. It hurt, but not enough to discourage me.

## The Second Attempt: Determination and Growth
Undeterred by my initial setback, I regrouped and resolved to give the OSCP another shot. Armed with newfound determination, I spent countless hours refining my skills, studying different attack techniques, and practicing on vulnerable systems. This time, I felt better equipped and confident that success was within reach. Alas, fate had other plans. While I made progress and performed better than before, I still fell short of the desired outcome. Frustration set in, but I knew I couldn't let it consume me.

## The Final Triumph: Passing the OSCP
After months of dedication, sleepless nights, and countless cups of coffee, the moment of truth arrived. Armed with both knowledge and experience, I confronted the OSCP exam with confidence and composure. This time, the challenges seemed more manageable, and I approached them methodically, leveraging the skills I had acquired over time. The hours of practice paid off as I gradually chipped away at each obstacle, gaining momentum and, eventually, reaching the finish line. The elation and relief I felt when I saw the words "Congratulations, you have passed" on my screen were indescribable.
