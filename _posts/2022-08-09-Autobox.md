# AutoBox Bash Script
I got tired of running the same commands over and over again and decided to automate first few steps when starting on a new pentest lab machine. I create Autobox to create a directory named after the machine I'm attacking as well create several sub-driectories to help organize my files while working.

[AutoBox GitHub](https://github.com/pharo-sec/AutoBox)

The script currently accepts two total arguments:

    The name of the machine
    The IP of the machine

It will create a directory within your current working directory named after the machine name given, inside this directory it creates several subdirectories:

    nmap: The nmap commands store their outputs here
    enumeration: A place to store your enumeration tools output
    shell: Files and methods required to gain a foothold on the machine
    priv-esc: Files and methods required to escalate privileges on the machine

It will then run a full port scan nmap against the host, save the output, extract the open ports, run an nmap service scan (-sV -sC), and finally save the output of that.
# Usage
```shell
$ ./AutoBox.sh [MACHINE]
```
It will then prompt for the IP of the machine

# Future Upgrades
I want to add more logic to the script to run more enumeration commands depending on the services identified, specifically:

- SMB
    - enum4linux
    - nmap SMB vuln scan
    - smbmap
- HTTP
    - Directory Bruteforce
    - Nikto
