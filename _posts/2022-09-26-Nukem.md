# Nukem Overview

Machine Details:

|IP|Hostname|Operating System|
|---|---|---|
|192.168.66.105|Nukem|Linux|

## Path to Exploitation
Nibbles is a box that requires us to attack a PostgreSQL server with weak credentials to gain access to the machine. From there, we abuse a vulnerable binary with the sticky bit (suid) to escalate to root. 

# Nukem Website

Landing page indicates that wordpress is on the host

After creating an account I can access the wp-admin page

![WP Admin Page](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Nukem/wp-admin.png)

Able to identify version of WordPress on the host

![WP Version](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Nukem/wp-version.png)

We run wp-scan and identify several out dated plugins and themes.

We find an RCE affecting this version of simple-file-list [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48979)

# Shell on Nukem

Use [this](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48979) exploit

modify the payload to send a shell to our host 

![Modified Exploit](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Nukem/modify-exploit.png)

Need to load the python virtual env to run the script with python3, run the following command in my home directory

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

Setup a listener and run the exploit

```
python3 Proving-Grounds/Nukem/exploit.py http://192.168.66.105
```

Checking on our listener we see we have a reverse shell

![Reverse Shell](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Nukem/rev-shell.png)

We find the local flag in the /home/commander directory

# Privilege Escalation
Interesting SUID Identified:

```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

We identify that the VNC server is running on the internal port 5901

![VNC Server](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Nukem/vnc-server.png)

Setup a local port forward to access the VNC server from our Kali machine

```bash
ssh -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 commander@192.168.66.105
```

Connect to the VNC server on Kali and provide commander's password

```bash
vncviewer 127.0.0.1:5901
```

![VNC Connection](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Nukem/vnc-connection.png)

We then launch the terminal application and will use the previously identified dosbox SUID binary

![VNC Terminal](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Nukem/vnc-terminal.png)

run the dosbox binary to get a DOS shell

![VNC dosbox](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Nukem/vnc-dosbox.png)

mount a drive to /etc

![VNC Mounted Drive](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Nukem/vnc-mount.png)

We can test our access and see that we can read the shows file, meaning we have elevated privileges

![Check for Root Access](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Nukem/root-check.png)

We can now add our current user to the sudoers file

```bash
echo commander ALL=(ALL) ALL >> sudoers
```

![Add User to Sudoers](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Nukem/sudoers-add.png)

Checking back in our SSH connection we see that our sudo permissions have been updated

```bash
sudo -l
```

![Checking Sudo Permissions](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Nukem/sudo-check.png)

We can now switch to the root user

```bash
sudo -s
```
